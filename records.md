<sup>1</sup> This will clarify the change that was made to change the time metrics.

<sup>2</sup> This is the time metrics for each puzzle. They do not include the time to open and read the `day#.txt` file. They will be abbreviated as appropriate. i.e. 1.54945 will be "1.55 s", 0.00127 will be "1.27 ms", and 135.21574 will be "2 m 15 s"
